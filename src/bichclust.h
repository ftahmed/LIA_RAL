 \brief BICHierarchical clustering class based on a BIC distance computed 
	over mono Gaussian

 The clustering is based upon a bottom-up hierarchical clustering. 
	Each segment is associated to a cluster providing the initial set of clusters. 
	The two closest clusters \f$c_i\f$ and \f$c_j\f$ are merged at each iteration 
	until a stop criterion is met. Various metric and stop criterion have been 
	proposed in [Siu1991,Solomonoff1998,Chen1998a,Reynolds1998]. One of 
	those is \f$\Delta BIC\f$ metric employed to select the clusters to group as 
	well as to stop the merge process. The candidate clusters \f$c_i\f$ and \f$c_j\f$ 
	are selected according to:
 \f[\min_{i>j, i \in \{1, \ldots, K\}}\Delta BIC_{i,j}\f]
 with \f$K\f$ the number of cluster. Moreover the merge process is 
	stopped when \f$\Delta BIC_{i,j} > 0\f$. 
 Two kinds of BIC metrics differing by the penalty factor are proposed: 
 \li the local BIC penalty factor \f$P_l\f$ with \f$n_i\f$ and \f$n_j\f$ 
	respectively the sum of segment length in \f$c_i\f$ and \f$c_j\f$:
 \f[P_l=\frac{1}{2}\left(d + \frac{d(d+1)}{2}\right) log(n_1+n_2)\f]
 \li or the global BIC penalty factor \f$P_g\f$ with \f$N\f$ the length of 
	the whole signal:
 \f[P_g=\frac{1}{2}\left(d + \frac{d(d+1)}{2}\right) log(N)\f]
 The LIMSI proved that local BIC penalty factor gives better result in 
 [Barras2004] and this is confirmed in [Tranter2004].
 Provide method to perform a hierarchical clustering.
 2 methods are provide: 
 \li to select the next candidates: the call of method #next returns the 
	next couples of clusters to merge.
 \li the merge are perform by the call of the #update method ;
	the couples of clusters are merge and models, distances are updated.\n
 then the end of the clustering could be control out side of the class.
